Description: PyStyl
        ======
        
        PyStyl is a Python package for stylometry or the quantitative analysis of writing style. PyStyl aims to be usable in three ways:
        * as a Python API (for Python programmers)
        * as a standalone command line tool (for technical users who don't write Python)
        * via a Graphical User Interface that runs in the browser (for non-technical users)
        
        PyStyl is pronounced 'pistol', because it is as fast as a gun - or at least, that is the goal.
        
        
        Installation
        ------
        PyStyl is still in its earliest stages of development, but if you would like to play around with it, clone the repository and run:
        
        ```python
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        While there are a few other dependencies, installing Anaconda should get you a long way. Most things currently work under Python 2.7+ and Python 3.

        ------
        PyStyl draws its inspiration from the ['Stylometry with R'](https://sites.google.com/site/computationalstylistics/home) project for computational stylistics.
